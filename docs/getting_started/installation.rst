Installation/Requirements
=========================

Required dependencies [#yaml]_
------------------------------

- Python 3.6+ (3.9 -- 3.11 recommended)
- ``pandas`` 1 (most of the system works with pandas 2 as well, but some of the :doc:`/cli` commands for downloading observational datasets using MONETIO might fail)
- ``pyyaml`` (to read control files)
- ``monet``, which brings `many dependencies <https://monet-arl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing.html>`__
- ``monetio``, which brings `a few dependencies <https://monetio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing.html>`__

Optional dependencies
---------------------

- ``netcdf4`` (`from Unidata <https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/>`__; most likely needed for reading model/obs datasets)
- ``wrf-python`` (needed in order to use the WRF-Chem reader; note that the version of ``wrf-python`` compatible with python=3.11 has known incompatibilities with newer ``netCDF4`` and ``setuptools`` versions — see *Incompatibilities* below)
- ``typer`` (to use the :doc:`/cli`;
  add ``rich`` `for <https://typer.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#060>`__ fancy tracebacks and ``--help``)
- ``pooch`` (to enable automatic downloading of :doc:`tutorial datasets </examples/tutorial-data>`)
- ``regionmask`` (`for complex region masking support <https://regionmask.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__; can read shapefiles, geojson, arbitrary polygons and predefined regions.)

Incompatibilities
-----------------
- ``pandas=1`` is incompatible with ``matplotlib`` 3.9+.
- ``wrf-python``, at least in the official conda-forge package, is not available for Python 3.12+, until `this build issue <https://github.com/conda-forge/wrf-python-feedstock/pull/70>`__ is resolved.
- The version of ``wrf-python`` compatible with python=3.11 has known incompatibilities with newer ``netCDF4`` and ``setuptools`` versions. Note that currently, MELODIES-MONET installs by default with Python 3.11 in conda. We have done some testing installing it from source with Python 3.14 (using the pip comand referred to in the :doc:`/develop/developers_guide`, which would avoid those issues, but note that testing this is still work in progress.
  This is an upstream issue. WRF-Chem users are strongly encouraged to use a pinned environment (see below).

General instructions
--------------------

If you are a user and are not planning to modify MELODIES-MONET itself,
installing it is relatively simple. There are two methods available.

Option 1) Using Conda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We have recently created a conda-forge release of MELODIES-MONET to make installation very simple 
with just 1 line of code below::

    $ conda create --name melodies-monet -y -c conda-forge \
      python=3.11 "netcdf4<1.7" "setuptools<70" wrf-python melodies-monet jupyterlab

.. note::
   WRF-Chem users may experience failures with newer ``netCDF4`` or ``setuptools`` versions due to upstream
   ``wrf-python`` incompatibilities. If you encounter errors when opening WRF-Chem datasets,
   please use pinned versions (e.g., ``netCDF4<1.7``, ``setuptools<70``).


Option 2) Using Conda and GitHub
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You are also welcome to install using our old method. The stable branch of MELODIES-MONET (``main``) 
should always be the same as the conda-forge release of MELODIES-MONET and be compatible with the
conda-forge releases of MONET/MONETIO.

First create and activate a conda environment::

    $ conda create --name melodies-monet python=3.11
    $ conda activate melodies-monet

Add dependencies from conda-forge::

    $ conda install -y -c conda-forge pyyaml pandas=1 'matplotlib-base<3.9' monet monetio netcdf4=1.7.2 wrf-python typer rich pooch jupyterlab
   
Now, install the stable branch of MELODIES-MONET to the environment::

    $ pip install --no-deps https://github.com/NCAR/MELODIES-MONET/archive/main.zip


.. note::
   If you are interested in modifying what MELODIES-MONET can do,
   take a look at the :doc:`/develop/developers_guide`.
